# Medium Markdown Example

A medium-length markdown file for testing purposes. It demonstrates various markdown features, including headings, lists, and code blocks.

## Styling

This is a paragraph with some **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for emphasis.

## Lists

Lists are useful for organizing information. Here are some examples:

- Item 1
